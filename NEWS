matrixprofiler 0.1.7
--------------------

-   Fixed issue on Makefile for Unix/Mac systems that triggered some
    CRAN policy about “Packages should not attempt to disable compiler
    diagnostics, nor to remove other diagnostic information such as
    symbols in shared objects.” The objective was to reduce the compiled
    library that even in release mode have being compiled in debug mode.
