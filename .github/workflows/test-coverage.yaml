# This action will test the code coverage of all R files that contains examples and
# Unit tests. This will be triggered using `workflow_run` after a successful run of
# the Lint action.
#
# This file must live on `main` branch, and any version in other branches will not
# be triggered. This is a "feature" of GH-actions. The workaround for working with
# the right branch is using the 'github.event.workflow_run.head_branch' on action
# 'actions/checkout'. Thanks to Potherca https://stackoverflow.com/a/65081720/2195337
